# syncomR
syncomR is an R package for handling microbial community (MC) data with special emphasis on time series data from synthetic MCs. Bundles R codes openly available in literature into functions for convinient access. Simplified visualization of multiple variables. Inspired by [rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg) research compendium approach for containerizing data analysis of my human gut synthetic minimal microbiome experiment.
