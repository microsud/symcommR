Description: The syncomR package is developed to analyse and visualize temporal microbial community profiles special emphasis ontime series data from synthetic MCs. Methods for ecological stability properties are from Liu et al., 2018. Ecological Stability Properties of Microbial Communities Assessed by Flow Cytometry, while community level temporal variability and succession is calculated with modified R code from Guittar J et al., 2019. Trait-based community assembly and succession of the infant gut microbiome.
