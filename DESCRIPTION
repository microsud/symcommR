Description: The syncomR package is developed to analyse and visualize temporal 
             microbial community profiles special emphasis ontime series data from 
             synthetic MCs. Methods for ecological stability properties are from 
             Liu et al., 2018. Ecological Stability Properties of Microbial Communities 
             Assessed by Flow Cytometry, while community level temporal variability and 
             succession is calculated with modified R code from Guittar J et al., 2019. 
             Trait-based community assembly and succession of the infant gut microbiome.
